Ooyala/Brightcove XBlock
========================

This XBlock allows to include Ooyala and Brightcove videos within an edX course.

**Note:** Ooyala is going to be shutdown around `April 2020` so the code supporting Ooyala playback will become useless and will be removed from this XBlock. 

It supports:

* **Ooyala Video**, the component to visualize the video.
* **Transcript**, which allows your users to interact with your video
  using text capabilities (video words, search, navigation).
* **Overlays**, which allows you to place raw text or HTML content at
  a specific moment in your video.
* **Player token**, which allows you to secure your video content
  using a token with an expiration time.

Installation
------------

Install the requirements into the python virtual environment of your
`edx-platform` installation by running the following command from the
root folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install requirements and the Ooyala XBlock itself.

Enabling in Studio
------------------

You can enable the Ooyala XBlock in Studio through the advanced
settings:

1. From the main page of a specific course, click on *Settings*,
   *Advanced Settings* in the top menu.
2. Locate the *advanced_modules* policy key, and add
   `"ooyala-player"` to the policy value list.
3. Click on the *Save changes* button.

Usage
-----

Once enabled, you can find _Ooyala Player_ component under the _Advanced_
tab in the Studio. When you add it to a course in the studio, the
block is set up with default content, shown in the screenshot
below.

### Overlays

In studio edit, you can add messages to be displayed at certain points
while the video is playing using overlays. You can add an overlay in
the studio by editing the _XML Configuration_ field.

Each overlay is configured using an `<overlay>` tag. The `start` and
`end` attributes control the time during video play while the overlay
is visible and should be given in seconds.

The content of an `<overlay>` tag can be either plain text or HTML
content wrapped in a `<html>` tag.

All overlays should be grouped under an `<overlays>` tag. Example:

```xml
<ooyala>
  <overlays>
    <overlay start="39" end="45"><html>Thats <b>Chris!!</b> one of our colleagues!</html></overlay>
    <overlay start="4"  end="15"><html><a href='http://www.edx.org'>Welcome</a> to <b>our course</b>!</html></overlay>
    <overlay start="16" end="20">This is raw text</overlay>
  </overlays>
</ooyala>
```
